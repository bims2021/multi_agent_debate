    "summary": "Both the Scientist and the Philosopher argued that AI should be regulated like medicine due to its potential to significantly impact human well-being and safety. They both emphasized the need for rigorous testing, oversight, and ethical considerations in the development and deployment of AI technologies. However, the Philosopher additionally emphasized the importance of ethical principles guiding medical regulations, such as beneficence, non-maleficence, and autonomy, and their relevance in AI development.",
    "reasoning": "While both the Scientist and the Philosopher made strong arguments for the regulation of AI like medicine, the Philosopher provided a more comprehensive argument by incorporating ethical principles that guide medical regulations. The Philosopher consistently emphasized the importance of beneficence, non-maleficence, and autonomy in AI development, which added depth to their argument. The Scientist, while making valid points, did not provide any unique perspectives or arguments that differentiated their stance from the Philosopher's. Therefore, the Philosopher prevailed in this debate.",
